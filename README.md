üï∑Ô∏è **Ungoliant is a high-performance pipeline that provides tools to build corpus generation pipelines from CommonCrawl.** üï∑Ô∏è


## Installation

### Installing/Compiling the binary
* Via `git`: `cargo install --git https://github.com/kargaranamir/ungoliant`

Ungoliant needs numerous dependencies that should be compiled when installing. However `cmake / gcc` can be needed as the project uses [fasttext-rs](https://github.com/messense/fasttext-rs).

### KenLM feature

The KenLM feature is optional because it relies on unsafe code that can break if the supplied model files are not correct.

To enable it, install KenLM requirements:

```bash
apt install -y libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev
```

and use `cargo install ungoliant --features kenlm` or `cargo b --features kenlm` if you're building from source.

### Getting a language identification file (for fastText):

By default, `ungoliant` expects the `lid.176.bin` model by meta. 
Use `wget https://huggingface.co/cis-lmu/glotlid/resolve/main/model.bin -O lid.176.bin` to get it.

However, you can use the model you want: just point to its path using `ungoliant download --lid-path <path to lid>`.

## Usage 

The usual way of generating corpora is:

1. Fetch the `wet.paths.gz` file from the last [CommonCrawl dump](https://commoncrawl.org/connect/blog/) and decompress it.
2. Download the files using the `download` command.
3. Generate the corpus using the `pipeline` command (it may take some time).
4. Head on to [oscar-tools](https://github.com/kargaranamir/oscar-tools) for the packaging steps

You can find more information on each command's `--help`.
